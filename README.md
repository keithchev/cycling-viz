## Introduction
This is a relatively simple interactive visualization of data collected from a GPS cycling computer.
The data consists of many one-dimensional time series; most obviously, lat/lon position coordinates, distance, speed, and elevation, but
also the power output by the cyclist, pedaling cadence, and heart rate.
